## 📝 About This Course
### 🌟 Generative Adversarial Networks

This course is part of udacity deep learning nano-degree program in which you can Learn to understand and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (generative adversarial network) to generate realistic images, with Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, and Jun-Yan Zhu, the creator of CycleGANs.

## 📝 About This Project
### ✔ Generate Faces

Learn to understand Generative Adversarial Networks with the
model’s inventor, Ian Goodfellow. Then, apply what you’ve learned
in this project and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN. This
DCGAN is made of a pair of multi-layer neural networks that
compete against each other until one learns to generate realistic
images of faces.
